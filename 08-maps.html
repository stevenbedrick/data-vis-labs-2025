<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> An aside: Vector
vs. Raster data</h2>
<p>In GIS-speak, these data sets are all <em>vector</em> data sets,
meaning that their contents are sets of x-y coordinates that define a
<em>feature</em> of some kind: a point (e.g., a specific grocery store),
a line or set of line segments (e.g., a road), or a polygon (e.g., the
outline of a neighborhood, or the shape of the bank of a river). Each
feature can have some number of <em>attributes</em>; what those
attributes are will depend on the specific data set.</p>
<p>In contrast to <em>vector</em> formats are <em>raster</em> formats
(sometimes called <em>bitmap</em> formats). Raster files consist of a
uniform grid of numbers (pixels), whose value contain whatever
information is being captured. One example of a raster image is a
digital photograph (perhaps taken from an airplane or satellite), in
which the pixel’s value corresponds to the intensity of light captured
at that exact point in the sensor’s field of view. but that is only one
form. Many kinds of remote sensing devices capture raster images, and in
fact there is no requirement that the values of each pixel correspond to
a sensor value at all- it can be a logical (categorical) value, as
well.</p>
<p>Crucially, raster images often contain multiple <em>channels</em>
(sometimes called <em>bands</em>), representing different sets of
spatially-aligned data. One example of this would be a visible-spectrum
true-color image, consisting of three bands (one for red, green, and
blue). Another example might be bands for sensors capturing at different
infrared wavelengths, or for different layers of data.</p>
<p>Like vector data, raster data files generally contain metadata
situating the pixels in a specific geographic coordinate reference
system. In other words, the raster file “knows” where its edges are in
space, and also knows how much distance each pixel is meant to cover.
One common raster file format is GeoTIFF, though there are certainly
others.</p>

<p>These clearly refer to some sort of spatial coordinates, and by
convention we can guess that they are in a projected (rather than
geographic) format- but without additional information it is difficult
to know how to interpret them. One major limitation of the CSV format is
that it does not make it easy to embed metadata like this in the file.
This is particularly important when working with geospatial data! As
such, we generally prefer to work with vector file formats such as
ESRI’s Shapefile format, which includes metadata.</p>

that the coordinates in this file are against the WGS 84 datum, and that
the units are meters. Beyond that, the exact details are, for the

sufficient information for us to plot these points on a map and combine
them with any other geospatial data we might encounter.</p>
<p>In many ways, the object we get back is <em>like</em> a data frame,
in that there are columns, which have types, etc. In fact, most

is called <code>geometry</code>, and is what store the actual
coordinates of whatever objects are stored in the rows. In this case,
each row is a tree, and the relevant <code>geometry</code> entry is a
point.</p>

<p>We see that in addition to the geometry of the boundaries themselves,
we also have other columns containing information about each
neighborhood. Notably, one of these is called <code>MAPLABEL</code>-
let’s take that as a suggestion and try labeling our regions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf() + geom_sf_label(aes(label=MAPLABEL))</code></pre>
<p>Note what is happening, here: <code>geom_sf_label()</code> provides a
new <code>ggplot</code> aesthetic to map (<code>label</code>), and we
are mapping it to a data value just like we would in any other geom.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the resulting map:</p>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This map on its own is not especially useful, due to all of the
overlap, but perhaps if we zoom in a bit? We can modify our map’s
viewport by using <code>coord_sf</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf() + 
  coord_sf(
    xlim=c(-13670000,-13630000), 
    ylim=c(5690000, 5710000)
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/changing%20our%20viewport-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that the units here are in the same CRS as the original
shapefile, but that the map itself is being displayed with
latitude/longitude tick marks. We’ll see shortly how we might convert
coordinates between the two CRSs, and also discuss what these numbers
mean. In the meantime, let’s zoom in some more (by specifying a narrower
range):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf() + 
  coord_sf(
    xlim=c(-13665000,-13655000),

<p>There’s something missing from our map: the two lovely rivers that
define our city’s geography. We have loaded a shapefile that describes
the river; let’s have a look:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>river_boundaries %&gt;% glimpse()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 1
## Columns: 6
## $ OBJECTID   &lt;int&gt; 1
## $ Id         &lt;int&gt; 6720

## $ Shape_Area &lt;dbl&gt; 114297817
## $ geometry   &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [m]&gt; MULTIPOLYGON (((-13669922 5...</code></pre>
<p>Unlike the <code>pdx_boundaries</code> data set, there’s not a lot of
additional information in this one beyond the raw geometry of the river
(the Portland Maps site does have additional data sets available that
include bathymetric and other data). What does this geometry look
like?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>river_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf()</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/just%20river-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Hey, there’s our rivers! But the shape is grey; how might we turn it
blue? <code>geom_sf</code> behaves like all other <code>ggplot</code>
directives, and allows us to set aesthetic parameters directly or map
them to data values:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>river_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf(fill=&quot;blue&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/blue%20river-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We may also note that this map took a few seconds to render. That is
because the geometry of the river is surprisingly complex, especially
along the banks of the Columbia. We can help it out a bit by turning off
the outline; rendering that is particularly challenging for the noisy
parts of the river bank:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>river_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf(fill=&quot;blue&quot;, size=0.0)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/river%20no%20outline-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Another option is to “simplify” the outline of the river, by
smoothing out some of the very detailed parts of the polygon. Depending
on the kind of map we are making, and the scale at which we are working,
this may or may not be appropriate, but for our purposes today it’s just
fine:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>river_boundaries %&gt;% st_simplify(dTolerance = 10) %&gt;% 
  ggplot() + geom_sf(fill=&quot;blue&quot;, size=0.0)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/river_simplified-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For the rest of this lab, we will work with a simplified version of
the river outline:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>river_boundaries &lt;- river_boundaries %&gt;% st_simplify(dTolerance = 10) </code></pre>
<p>Now, how do we combine our river layer with our neighborhood boundary
layer? Regular <code>ggplot</code> geoms can be combined arbitrarily,
and so can <code>geom_sf</code> layers:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf() + geom_sf(data=river_boundaries, fill=&quot;blue&quot;, size=0.0)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/river%20and%20city-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Putting it all together, we can see that <code>coord_sf</code>
applies to both data layers, and also that regular ggplot themeing
applies here as well:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + 
  geom_sf() + 
  geom_sf(data=river_boundaries, fill=&quot;blue&quot;, size=0.0) + 
  coord_sf(xlim=c(-13670000,-13630000), ylim=c(5690000, 5710000)) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Converting between
geographic coordinates and projection coordinates</h1>
<p>The coordinates that the Portland Maps data are using are not in
lat/long, but rather in meters (as can be seen by closely examining the
output of <code>st_crs</code>). If you’d rather work with latitude and
longitude, or if you need to get them to line up with data from a
different source, you can convert back and forth between CRSs using
<code>sf_project()</code>. The key is knowing how to tell
<code>sf_project()</code> which CRS to use.</p>
<p>One option would be to give it all of the extensive and detailed
information about the projection and datum that is found using
<code>st_crs()</code>; fortunately, there exists a standardized registry
of spatial reference systems, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPSG_Geodetic_Parameter_Dataset">EPSG
Geodetic Parameter Dataset</a>, and we can look up CRS configurations
using their EPSG reference number.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through how to use <code>sf_project()</code>. First, we’ll
need a point in WGS84-space:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p1 &lt;- data.frame(lon=c(-122.65), lat=c(45.5))</code></pre>
<p>Next, we figure out the EPSG numbers for our source and target CRS.
Our source CRS is WGS84, whose CRS number is 4326; let’s say that we
wanted to project it into the space that the Portland Maps data is
using, so that we could overlay the points or do some sort of distance
calculation. The Portland Maps dataset uses EPSG 3857, also known as
“Web Mercator”. This is basically WGS84, but it has been “quasi-Mercator
projected,” and converted to use meters as units and easting/northing as
its direction system (instead of lat/long).</p>
<p>Web Mercator is used by a variety of mapping software packages
(including Google Maps, etc.), hence why it’s what Portland Maps gives.
The motivation behind Web Mercator is that it depends on a spherical
projection geometry (rather than the ellipsoidal projection used by
vanilla Mercator). This makes it vastly simpler to work with from a
computational perspective… at the cost of substantially decreased
accuracy at northern latitudes, even by Mercator standards. For this
reason, the metadata includes a <code>USAGE</code> note saying that it
is only specified for use at latitudes between 85º N and 85º S. In
practice, it is best to not push things even that far; you’ll see
notable distortion by the time you get to Norway and Alaska.</p>
<p>Anyway now that we know which CRS systems are in play, we can use
<code>sf_project()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sf_project(
  sf::st_crs(4326), # from: default datum used by geom_sf
  sf::st_crs(3857), # to: datum used by Portland Maps data
  p1
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           [,1]    [,2]
## [1,] -13653336 5700583</code></pre>
<p>The process works in reverse:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p2 &lt;- data.frame(lon=c(-13653336), lat=c(5700583))
sf_project(
  sf::st_crs(3857), # from: datum used by Portland Maps data

## [1,] -122.65 45.5</code></pre>
<p>Another common way to define a CRS is with a “<code>PROJ.4</code>”
string. Instead of referring to a standard, predefined projection as
with an EPSG code, the proj.4 string includes all of the necessary
information to describe an arbitrary projection. Consider this example,
from the <code>geom_sf</code> documentation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world1 &lt;- sf::st_as_sf(map(&#39;world&#39;, plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = world1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code># now, project to a Lambert Equal-Area Projection, centered at Antarctica:
world2 &lt;- sf::st_transform(
  world1,
  &quot;+proj=laea +y_0=0 +lon_0=155 +lat_0=-90 +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs&quot;
)
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = world2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A deep-dive into proj.4 strings is beyond the scope of this lab, but
as a challenge: look closely at that string, and see if you can think of
a way to modify it to project centered on Portland (lon: -122.65, lat:
45.5), to make the following plot:</p>

in additional layers- perhaps the routes of I-5 and I-205. Other major
arterial roads may also be important (Foster, Powell, and 82nd on the
East side come to mind, as does Barbur and Capitol Highway on the West
side).</p>
<p>With this many data points, it may begin to make sense to look not at
discrete points but rather at a density or contour plot. Making this is
a tiny bit more complicated, since the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>
columns in this particular data set do not seem to be in the same
coordinate system, and it is not entirely obvious from the Portland Maps
site what system those columns are in. 😣 Fortunately, the points in the
<code>$geometry</code> column are just fine, and we can extract those
using <code>st_coordinates</code> for use by
<code>stat_density_2d</code>:</p>

<div id="now-lets-look-at-the-trees" class="section level2"
number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Now let’s look at the
trees</h2>
<p>The tree inventory data set is a different kettle of fish altogether.
First, it is much larger:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nrow(trees_shape)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 25534</code></pre>
<p>This means that plotting these points is going to be a lot more work
for R. Furthermore, the distribution of the points is rather clumpy:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf() + 
  geom_sf(data=river_boundaries, fill=&quot;blue&quot;, size=0.0) + 
  geom_sf(data=trees_shape)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/initial%20trees-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In essence, each of those black blobs is hundreds of points overlaid
on top of one another. If we do a contour map, we can see this more
clearly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf() + stat_density_2d(data=trees_raw, aes(X, Y))</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/tree%20contour-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What is going on, here? Well, let’s zoom in a bit on Southwest
portland:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pdx_boundaries %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf() + geom_sf(data=river_boundaries, fill=&quot;blue&quot;, size=0.0) + geom_sf(data=trees_shape) + coord_sf(xlim=c(-13662000,-13658000), ylim=c(5693059, 5697583))</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That large clump up in the upper left-hand corner is Gabriel Park,
and we can see now that the individual points in this data set are
crammed in close together because they represent trees that are
literally next to one another in a park. Our contour map above is really
just showing us what parts of town have a lot of tree-filled parks!</p>
<p>Let’s explore the tree data a bit more by zooming in to Gabriel Park.
We’ll first subset our data to only include trees in that park, so let’s
eyeball a bounding box:</p>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can guesstimate some lon/lat coordinates, and project them into
map units:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p3 &lt;- data.frame(lon=c(-122.725, -122.7125), lat=c(45.4675, 45.478))

## [1,] -13661685 5695423
## [2,] -13660293 5697089</code></pre>
<p>And then use <code>st_crop</code> to filter our data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trees_in_park &lt;- st_crop(trees_shape, xmin=-13661685, ymin=5695423, xmax=-13660293, ymax=5697089)

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Number of trees in our bounding box: 618&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If we zoom in to just this box, what does our map look like?</p>

<p>The <code>basemaps</code> package (which is fabulous, but also
slightly buggy, so we won’t be using it much this week), has a handy
function called <code>draw_ext</code> that will let us interactively
draw a bounding box (as well as other shape features, such as polygons).
Invoke it like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>some.bbox.of.interest &lt;- basemaps::draw_ext()</code></pre>
<p>An interactive map will appear (implemented using Shiny!), looking
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/draw_ext_screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>The result will be a <code>sfc</code> object with unprojected points
in the WGS84 CRS, so you’ll probably need to convert it into your map’s
CRS, but it can be a lot faster and easier than manually guessing
coordinates.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">4.2.0.1.2</span> Let R do the

<p>Another option is to let R do the work- if you have a particular
point of interest (the centroid of a neighborhood, a particular tree,
etc.) you can use functions like <code>st_buffer()</code> to create a
region extending out a certain radius from your point, and then use
<code>st_bbox()</code> to compute that region’s bounding box. There
exist a whole suite of other functions that can be used in a similar
workflow (<code>st_touches</code>, etc.), as well. This method can be a
little more work for you as a programmer, but will be more versatile and
— importantly — more amenable to automation.</p>

<p>Note that, besides the trees themselves, this map is kind of boring.
We can start to see the layout of trees in the park, but it’s hard to
know how to contextualize it. At this zoom level, our neighborhood
boundary data set is no longer especially useful. We might instead want
other features: roads, etc. Or, we might want to base our map on other
data entirely, like perhaps an aerial photo. One option would be for us
to find that data (roads, for instance, are available from Portland
Maps) and manually add it, the way we did with the rivers. There are
easier options, however. Let’s look at how we might use a richer,
pre-built map using OpenStreetMap data and <code>ggmap</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ggmap" class="section level2" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span>
<code>ggmap</code></h2>
<p>`<code>ggmap</code> is a package that tries to make it convenient to
quickly access raster map tiles through either Google Maps or
OpenStreetMap to use as a “basemap”. Note that hosting map tiles is
expensive and a bit complicated, so it is mostly done by companies; both
Google and <a href="https://www.stadiamaps.com/">Stadia Maps</a> are
good bets. They both have very generous free tiers of service that will
be more than adequate for any normal use you are likely to
encounter.</p>
<p>I recommend starting with Stadia. You will need to make an account
with them, and then tell R to use your account’s API key, like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>register_stadiamaps(&quot;YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, write=FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Once we’ve done that, we may begin using <code>ggmap</code>. We
generate a basemap using <code>get_stadiamap()</code> (there are related
functions for different tile sets).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>park_base_map &lt;- get_stadiamap(
  c(left=-122.725, bottom=45.4675, right=-122.7125, top=45.478), # note: in practice, we wouldn&#39;t enter these by hand, we would use st_bbox() or something similar!
  zoom=16,
  maptype=&quot;stamen_terrain&quot;) # try experimenting with &quot;toner&quot;, etc.  </code></pre>
<pre><code>## ℹ © Stadia Maps © Stamen Design © OpenMapTiles © OpenStreetMap contributors.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggmap(park_base_map)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now, we are ready to try plotting the trees over our base map. Our
trees and basemap are in different projections, and <code>ggmap</code>
can’t quite handle that situation “on its own”. We must manually
re-project our trees’ locations:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ggmap isn&#39;t smart enough to reproject, so we need to by hand
trees_park_projected &lt;- st_transform(trees_in_park, sf::st_crs(4326))</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can use our re-projected trees and our basemap:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggmap(park_base_map) + 
  geom_sf(data=trees_park_projected, inherit.aes = FALSE) # note - this is needed due to a slight quirk between ggmap, ggplot, and geom_sf</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><code>geom_sf</code> still work the way we’ve been using it; now that
we have our points on a map, let’s color by the type of tree:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggmap(park_base_map) + 
  geom_sf(data=trees_park_projected, inherit.aes = FALSE, 
          alpha=0.5, 
          mapping=aes(color=Genus)) # just like any other ggplot geom</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Coordinate system already present. Adding new coordinate system, which
## will replace the existing one.</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Clearly, there are too many levels for this variable to be truly
useful; we would want to do some sort of additional categorizing. But it
<em>is</em> enough to see that there are some general patterns of what
kinds of trees were inventoried in which part of the park!</p>
</div>
<div id="ggspatial" class="section level2" number="4.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span>
<code>ggspatial</code></h2>
<p><code>ggspatial</code> is another extension to <code>ggplot</code>
that makes OpenStreetMap base data easy to work with. Unlike
<code>ggmap</code>, it <em>is</em> able to automatically deal with
projections:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># look, Ma, no re-projection needed!

<p><code>mapview</code> has <em>many</em> options, for changing the
basemap, to setting colors, etc. Note, also, that it is perfectly happy
to deal with projection issues for us! We do not need to manually
project or otherwise transform our data- it figures it out on its
own.</p>
<p>Again, it is <em>not</em> for presentation-quality graphics, but more
for data exploration. It integrates well with Shiny (via
<code>mapviewOutput</code>/<code>renderMapview</code>), as well!</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Fancier:
Leaflet</h3>
<p><a href="https://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> is a somewhat fancier and
more powerful library for interactive maps that is widely used outside
of the R ecosystem, but which has excellent R integration. We will also
use the <code>leaflet.esri</code> extension, so we can use ESRI’s aerial
photos.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.esri)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: leaflet.extras</code></pre>
<p>As with <code>ggmap</code>, Leaflet wants things in WGS84 and will
not automatically reproject our data for us, so we will need to work
with <code>trees_park_projected</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># now make a map with leaflet!
leaflet(trees_park_projected) %&gt;% # we can pass in a dataframe to use...

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> How about a chloropleth
map?</h1>
<p>Changing gears, we now turn to chloropleth maps. As we discussed on
Monday, a very important consideration when working with a chloropleth
map is that one must <em>normalize</em> quantities consistently across
the regions of the map.</p>
<p>Continuing with our Portland-themed lab, we will be working with a <a
href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/civic/28387">dataset produced by
the City</a> that aligns our neighborhood districts with their
corresponding data from the 2010 Census. This data set includes a great
deal of information about each neighborhood’s demographics; for now, we
will work with the total population.</p>
<p>We will need to <em>join</em> our existing dataframe of neighborhood
boundaries with this Census dataset; while both include neighborhood
names, there is some variability in how the neighborhoods are referred
to (“PEARL” vs. “PEARL DISTRICT”) that we must deal with. This issue is
extremely common when working with this kind of data, especially at the
level of neighborhoods. Many administrative regions/districts have
standardized numerical codes, maintained by the USGS and the Census
Bureau, and you will likely have better luck using those to merge
datasets rather than relying on names.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve got the population column, we can tell
<code>geom_sf</code> to use it for the “fill” aesthetic:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>boundaries_with_pop %&gt;% ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill=Total.Pop)) +
  scale_fill_gradient() +
  geom_sf(data=river_boundaries, fill=&quot;blue&quot;, size=0.0) </code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is, of course, ignoring the first rule of chloropleth maps:
beware of differing region sizes! We should really be plotting
<em>population density</em>- people per square kilometer, or something
like that. Our shapefile with Portland’s neighborhoods helpfully
includes a column with each neighborhood’s area, in square meters, for
precisely this purpose.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># compute people per square kilometer
# NB: Shape_Area is in meters^2
boundaries_with_pop &lt;- boundaries_with_pop %&gt;% 
  mutate(adj_pop = (Total.Pop / (Shape_Area / 1E6))) %&gt;% arrange(adj_pop)</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s look at our revised map:</p>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/first%20attempt%20at%20density%20map-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That’s much better!</p>

Challenge #7:
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Look at the original spreadsheet and pick another column of interest
(besides total population); revise the data ingest process, and map
<em>that</em> column instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="setting-color-scales" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Setting Color
Scales</h2>
<p>The default colors have three big issues:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>They are blue, so conflict with the river</li>
<li>We have some missing data (i.e., neighborhoods where we don’t have
population data) and those are not apparent in this scale</li>
<li>The scale may be highlighting certain differences at the expense of
others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s explore some different coloring options! First, let’s
familiarize ourselves with the data distribution across
neighborhoods.</p>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see straight away that the distribution is not uniform- there
are some outlier neighborhoods with much higher population density.
Another way to look at this is with a histogram:</p>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If we have uniform distribution of data, a uniform color scale may be
what we want, but in this case it is not: the color range is going to be
very compressed down in the range at which most of the data lives. Let’s
explore four different options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Equal spacing across the entire range of data</li>
<li>Quantile spacing (i.e., color breaks at each quantile boundary)</li>
<li>A simple breaking scheme that takes into account the data’s
variability (i.e., more breaks for more variable data)</li>
<li>A more sophisticated adaptive scheme (Jenks’ algorithm), that looks
for “natural” breaks in the range of data.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># following https://blog.datawrapper.de/how-to-choose-a-color-palette-for-choropleth-maps/
# and https://rpubs.com/danielkirsch/styling-choropleth-maps

min.pop &lt;- min(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, na.rm=TRUE)
max.pop &lt;- max(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, na.rm=TRUE)
diff.pop &lt;- max.pop - min.pop
std.dev.pop &lt;- sd(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, na.rm = TRUE)

# some possible color break points

jenks.interval &lt;- classIntervals(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, n=6, style=&#39;jenks&#39;)$brks

# now assign neighborhoods to their bin, using each of these methods:

# 6 equal cut-points across the population range
boundaries_with_pop$pop.equal = cut(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, breaks=equal.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)

# Cut-points at population quantiles
boundaries_with_pop$pop.quantile = cut(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, breaks=quantile.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)

# Cut points at increments of the standard deviation of the dataset
boundaries_with_pop$pop.std = cut(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, breaks=std.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)

# Jenks&#39;s algorithm for adaptive breakpoints
boundaries_with_pop$pop.jenks = cut(boundaries_with_pop$adj_pop, breaks=jenks.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can visualize which neighborhoods would be colored similarly
under the different schemes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>popDensBarChart &lt;- function(break_col) {
  boundaries_with_pop %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(adj_pop)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=fct_reorder(MAPLABEL, -adj_pop), y=adj_pop)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill=.data[[break_col]])) +
    # theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=270, hjust=0, size=6, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
    scale_y_continuous(name=expression(&quot;People/km&quot; ^2)) +
  scale_x_discrete(name=NULL) +
    scale_fill_discrete(guide=FALSE) +
  ggtitle(break_col)
}

plot_grid(
  popDensBarChart(&quot;pop.equal&quot;),
  popDensBarChart(&quot;pop.quantile&quot;),
  popDensBarChart(&quot;pop.std&quot;),
  popDensBarChart(&quot;pop.jenks&quot;),
  nrow=2, ncol=2
)</code></pre>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see here that the quantile method is probably not what we
want: lots of the denser counties are getting lumped together in a way
that they probably shouldn’t be. Now let’s try using different ones of
these for our map. While we’re at it, we are going to change our color
scheme as well.</p>
<p><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/map%20with%20different%20breaks-1.png" width="672" /><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/map%20with%20different%20breaks-2.png" width="672" /><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/map%20with%20different%20breaks-3.png" width="672" /><img src="08-maps_files/figure-html/map%20with%20different%20breaks-4.png" width="672" /></p>
