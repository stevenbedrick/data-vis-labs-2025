# Goals for Lab 01

- Get your feet wet!
- Innoculate you against `ggplot2` errors- we all get them!
- Get exposed to the *range* of things you can do, before we go **deep**...
- Develop your *own* **personal** preferences for data visualizations!
    - Do you like or hate gridlines?
    - What fonts do you find pleasant to read?
    - What kinds of colors do you like?
    - Are you team `theme_gray` or `theme_bw` (or `theme_minimal`)?
    
These are important questions, and I want you to develop (well-informed) opinions on these matters!

Most of the things we cover today, we will be re-visiting later in the term; you are not expected to be familiar with all of the R functions or patterns that we are using.

Other things to think about for this lab:

- Try not to copy-and-paste code:
  - Becoming efficient/proficient with R depends on building muscle memory, and the only way to do that is to type
  - By typing, you _will_ introduce errors, and this is a good chance to get practice at interpreting and fixing them.
- Take note of steps or functions that involve bits of R that you are unfamiliar with- this lab will help you identify particular areas that you are comfortable with as well as areas you will want to focus on.

# Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest

![](https://i0.wp.com/flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/hot-dogs1.gif?zoom=2&fit=900%2C423)

This includes a reconstruction of [Nathan Yau's hot dog contest example](http://flowingdata.com/2009/07/02/whos-going-to-win-nathans-hot-dog-eating-contest/hot-dogs-2/), as interpreted by Jackie Wirz, ported into R and `ggplot2` by Steven Bedrick for a workshop for the [OHSU Data Science Institute](https://ohsulibrary-datascienceinstitute.github.io), and finally adapted, made idiomatic, and improved by Alison Hill for all you intrepid Data-Viz-onauts!


First, we load our packages: 


```{r eval=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(extrafont)
library(here)
```


# Read in and wrangle data

Next, we load some data. In the Posit Cloud project for this lab, you will see a `data` directory with the necessary files. We can read it in using `read_csv`, and along the way use `col_factor` to tell it how to handle the gender column.

```{r}
hot_dogs <- read_csv(here::here("data", "hot_dog_contest.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(
      gender = col_factor(levels = NULL)
    ))
```

## Validation

Check it out, once it is read in, and make sure it looks like this!

```{r}
glimpse(hot_dogs)
hot_dogs
```

At this point, follow the HLO process and familiarize yourself with the columns and their contents. Questions to ask:

1. Are the types of the columns what you would expect? Note that this requires that you have some notion of what to expect! Possible things to think about:
  1. What type makes sense for a column representing a year?
  2. What about the `num_eaten` column?
  3. What about the `gender` column? What assumptions
2. What are the minimum and maximum values in the numeric columns? Are the values in the range you would expect?
3. Are there any missing values?

In addition to `glimpse()`, try loading (not installing) the `skimr` package and using its `skim()` function on the `hot_dogs` data frame.

## Adding a variable

In addition to the information that is already _in_ the dataset itself, we know that we will also be wanting to somehow include information about whether a given year was before or after the incorporation of the competitive eating league. Let's add an _indicator variable_ to the data using `mutate()`. Also, the data's a little sketchy pre-1981, and for our purposes today we'll be focusing on males only, so let's do some `filter`ing, as well:

```{r}
hot_dogs <- hot_dogs %>% 
  mutate(post_ifoce = year >= 1997) %>% 
  filter(year >= 1981 & gender == 'male')
hot_dogs
```



# Plot The Data

Now let's try making a first crack at a plot:

```{r}
ggplot(hot_dogs, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col()
```

Note that our data is already in "counted" form, so we're using `geom_col()` instead of `geom_bar()`.

We will now progressively improve this visualization, one step at a time.

# Add Axis Labels And Title


```{r}
ggplot(hot_dogs, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)")
```

# Play With Colors

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">Challenge #1:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Make 3 versions of the last plot we just made:

* __In the first,__ make all the columns outlined in "white".
* __In the second,__ make all the columns outlined in "white" and filled in "navyblue".
* __In the third,__ make all the columns outlined in "white" and filled in according to whether or not `post_ifoce` is TRUE or FALSE (use default colors for now).

_HINT:_ `color` and `fill` are two of `ggplot`'s aesthetic mapping variables (i.e., "things about how the plot looks that we get to specify")

  </div>
</div>



```{r}
ggplot(hot_dogs, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "white") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)")
```

```{r}
ggplot(hot_dogs, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "white", fill = "navyblue") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)")
```

```{r}
ggplot(hot_dogs, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = post_ifoce), colour = "white") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)")
```



<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">Challenge #2:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
What if you want to change the legend in the last plot you made? Use google to figure out how to do the following:

* Delete the legend title
* Make the legend text either "Post-IFOCE" or "Pre-IFOCE".

HINT: in `ggplot`, legends are controlled by the relevant scale (color, fill, etc.) that they are mapped to.

  </div>
</div>

```{r}
ggplot(hot_dogs, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = post_ifoce), colour = "white") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "",
                      labels=c("Pre-IFOCE", "Post-IFOCE"))
```

# Change The Dataset

Now, let's change the question a little bit. Up to this point, we have looked at HDB performance relative to  the _creation_ of the IFOCE. What if what matters is the _affiliation_ of the contestants (i.e., whether or not the contestants are members of the IFOCE or not)? We'll need some different data for this. Through the _Magic Of Data Scienceâ„¢_, we have dug that information up and put it into an expanded version of our CSV file, which you can find in the data directory.


<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">Challenge #3:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Let's work with this new dataset! Do the following:

* Read in the "hot_dog_contest_with_affiliation.csv" data file, using `col_types` to read in `affiliated` and `gender` as factors. 
* Within a `mutate`, create a new variable called `post_ifoce` that is TRUE if `year` is greater than or equal to 1997. 
* Also `filter` the new data for only years 1981 and after, and only for male competitors.
  </div>
</div>

```{r eval = FALSE}
hdm_affil <- read_csv(here::here("data", "hot_dog_contest_with_affiliation.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(
      affiliated = col_factor(levels = NULL), 
      gender = col_factor(levels = NULL)
      )) %>% 
  mutate(post_ifoce = year >= 1997) %>% 
  filter(year >= 1981 & gender == "male") 
```





```{r}
hdm_affil <- read_csv(here::here("data", "hot_dog_contest_with_affiliation.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(
      affiliated = col_factor(levels = NULL), 
      gender = col_factor(levels = NULL)
      )) %>% 
  mutate(post_ifoce = year >= 1997) %>% 
  filter(year >= 1981 & gender == "male") 
glimpse(hdm_affil)
```

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">Challenge #4:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Let's do some basic EDA with this new dataset! Do the following:

* Use `dplyr::distinct` to figure out how many unique values there are of `affiliated`.
* Use `dplyr::count` to count the number of rows for each unique value of `affiliated`; use `?count` to figure out how to sort the counts in descending order.
  </div>
</div>

```{r}
hdm_affil %>% 
  distinct(affiliated)
hdm_affil %>% 
  count(affiliated, sort = TRUE)
```


Now let's plot this new data, and fill the columns according to our new `affiliated` column.

```{r}
ggplot(hdm_affil, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = affiliated)) + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)")
```

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">Challenge #5:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Do the following updates to the last plot we just made:

* Update the colors using hex colors: `c('#E9602B','#2277A0','#CCB683')`. 
* Change the legend title to "IFOCE-affiliation". 
* Save this plot object as "affil_plot".
  </div>
</div>

```{r}
affil_plot <- ggplot(hdm_affil, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = affiliated)) + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#E9602B','#2277A0','#CCB683'),
                    name = "IFOCE-affiliation")
affil_plot
```

# Play With Scales & Coordinates

Now that the bones of the plot are in place, it's time to tweak the details.

The spacing's a little funky down near the origin of the plot. The [documentation](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html) tells us that the defaults are `c(0.05, 0)` for continuous variables. The first number is multiplicative and the second is additive. 

The default was that 2.15 ((2024-1981)*.05+0) was added to the right and left sides of the x-axis as padding, so the effective default limits were `c(1979, 2026)`.

Let's tighten that up with the `expand` property for the `scale_y_continuous` (we'll also change the breaks for y-axis tick marks here) and `scale_x_continuous` settings:

```{r}
affil_plot <- affil_plot + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),
                     breaks = seq(0, 70, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))
affil_plot
```



That is perhaps _too_ tight; note the lack of any space between the bars and the y-axis on hte left.

Let's loosen things up a bit by updating the plot coordinates. 

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">Challenge #6:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Use `coord_cartesian` to:

* Set the x-axis range to 1980-2024
* Set the y-axis range to 0-80
  </div>
</div>

Using `coord_cartesian` is the preferred layer here because (from the `coord_cartesian` documentation): "setting limits on the coordinate system will zoom the plot (like you're looking at it with a magnifying glass), and will not change the underlying data like setting `limits` on a scale will."  

In other words, setting `limits` will actually result in individual data points being included or excluded from the plot based on whether they fall within the specified limits, which could have unanticipated effects (for example, if your plot includes a line fit, that line fit will be done using only the included data rather than all of your data).

<div class="panel panel-info">
  <div class="panel-heading">Lesson:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Don't directly change `limits` unless you really know what you are doing! Most of the time, you want to change the coordinates instead, and do any data point filtering outside of your plotting.
  </div>
</div>

```{r}
affil_plot <- affil_plot + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1980, 2025), ylim = c(0, 80)) 
affil_plot
```


# Play With Theme Settings

We will talk a lot more about themes and `ggplot` later in the term, but for now, the important thing to know is that most visual aspects of the plot have a _name_ (e.g. `plot.title`), and the `theme()` function lets us tell `ggplot` what any [named part](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html) of the plot should look like.

Let's change some key theme settings:

```{r}
affil_plot +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color = "gray80", linewidth = 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_line(color = "gray80", linewidth = 0.5))
```

<div class="panel panel-info">
  <div class="panel-heading">Lesson:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
You can change *almost anything* that your heart desires to change! 
  </div>
</div>


By default, plot titles in `ggplot2` are left-aligned. For `hjust`:

- `0` == left
- `0.5` == centered
- `1` == right

We could also save all these as a custom theme. We are not fans of the default font, so we are also going to change this. To do this, you need to install the (`extrafont` package)[https://github.com/wch/extrafont] and follow its setup instructions before doing this next step.

```{r}
hot_diggity <- theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                     axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
                     panel.background = element_blank(),
                     axis.line.x = element_line(color = "gray80", linewidth = 0.5),
                     axis.ticks = element_line(color = "gray80", linewidth = 0.5),
                     text = element_text(family = "Lato") # need extrafont for this
                     )
```



```{r}
affil_plot + hot_diggity 
```

We could also use someone else's theme:

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
affil_plot + theme_fivethirtyeight(base_family = "Lato")
affil_plot + theme_tufte( base_family = "Palatino")
```




The final thing we have to mess with is the x-axis ticks and labels. We'll do this in two steps, then override our previous layer `scale_x_continuous`.

```{r}
# manually compute a list of years that we want labeled...
years_to_label <- seq(from = 1981, to = 2024, by = 4) 
years_to_label

# add a column to the dataframe containing what we want each year's label to be
hd_years <- hdm_affil %>%
  distinct(year) %>% 
  mutate(year_lab = ifelse(year %in% years_to_label, year, ""))
```

```{r}
# manually tell ggplot what to use for breaks and labels
affil_plot + 
  hot_diggity +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
                     breaks = hd_years$year,
                     labels = hd_years$year_lab)
```

# Final (final, final) version

Don't name your files "final" :)

![](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)

All together in one chunk, here is our final (for now) plot! I'm also adding some additional elements here to show you options:

```{r}
nathan_plot <- ggplot(hdm_affil, aes(x = year, y = num_eaten)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = affiliated)) + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Hot Dogs and Buns Consumed") +
  ggtitle("Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1981-2024", subtitle = "(Male contestants only)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#E9602B','#2277A0','#CCB683'),
                    name = "IFOCE-affiliation") + 
  hot_diggity +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),
                     breaks = seq(0, 70, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
                     breaks = hd_years$year,
                     labels = hd_years$year_lab) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1980, 2025), ylim = c(0, 80)) 
nathan_plot
```



The fill legend is doing its job, here, but we might instead want to use direct annotations on the plot itself, to make it easier and faster to read. 

`ggplot` will let us add _annotatations_ to the plot- i.e., extra text, lines , etc. that are not derived from the data in the plot, but are manually specified - using the `annotate()` function, which adds additional layers to the plot. The way we are doing it below is a bit tedious, but demonstrates how it works.

```{r}
nathan_ann <- nathan_plot +
  guides(fill="none") + # turn off the legend/guide for the "fill" aesthetic
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1980, 2025), ylim = c(0, 90)) +
  annotate('segment', x=1980.75, xend=2000.25, y= 30, yend=30, linewidth=0.5, color="#CCB683")+
  annotate('segment', x=1980.75, xend=1980.75, y= 30, yend=28, linewidth=0.5, color="#CCB683") +
  annotate('segment', x=2000.25, xend=2000.25, y= 30, yend=28, linewidth=0.5, color="#CCB683") +
  annotate('segment', x=1990, xend=1990, y= 33, yend=30, linewidth=0.5, color="#CCB683") +
  annotate('text', x=1990, y=36, label="No MLE/IFOCE Affiliation", color="#CCB683", family="Lato", hjust=0.5, size = 3) +



  annotate('segment', x=2000.75, xend=2006.25, y= 58, yend=58, linewidth=0.5, color="#2277A0") +
  annotate('segment', x=2000.75, xend=2000.75, y= 58, yend=56, linewidth=0.5, color="#2277A0") +
  annotate('segment', x=2006.25, xend=2006.25, y= 58, yend=56, linewidth=0.5, color="#2277A0") +
  annotate('segment', x=2003.5, xend=2003.5, y= 61, yend=58, linewidth=0.5, color="#2277A0") +
  annotate('text', x=2003.5, y=65, label="MLE/IFOCE\nFormer Member", color="#2277A0", family="Lato", hjust=0.5, size = 3) +


  annotate('segment', x=2006.75, xend=2024.25, y= 79, yend=79, linewidth=0.5, color="#E9602B") +
  annotate('segment', x=2006.75, xend=2006.75, y= 79, yend=77, linewidth=0.5, color="#E9602B") +
  annotate('segment', x=2024.25, xend=2024.25, y= 79, yend=77, linewidth=0.5, color="#E9602B") +
  annotate('segment', x=2015, xend=2015, y= 82, yend=79, linewidth=0.5, color="#E9602B") +
  annotate('text', x=2015, y=86, label="MLE/IFOCE Current Member", color="#E9602B", family="Lato", hjust=0.5, size = 3)
nathan_ann
```

Finally, adding in another layer of data, including information about female contestants:

```{r}
hdm_females <- read_csv(here::here("data", "hot_dog_contest_with_affiliation.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(
      affiliated = col_factor(levels = NULL), 
      gender = col_factor(levels = NULL)
      )) %>% 
  mutate(post_ifoce = year >= 1997) %>% 
  filter(year >= 1981 & gender == "female") 
glimpse(hdm_females)
```

```{r}
nathan_w_females <- nathan_ann +
  # add in the female data, and manually set a fill color
  geom_col(data = hdm_females, 
           width = 0.75, 
           fill = "#F68A39") +
  labs(subtitle = NULL) # no longer need the subtitle warning about male-only data!
nathan_w_females
```

And adding a final caption:

```{r}
caption <- paste(strwrap("* From 2011 on, separate Men's and Women's prizes have been awarded. All female champions to date have been MLE/IFOCE-affiliated.", 70), collapse="\n")

nathan_w_females +
  # now an asterisk to set off the female scores, and a caption
  annotate('text', x = 2011, y = 36, label="*", family = "Lato", size = 8) +
  labs(caption = caption) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(family = "Lato", size=8, hjust=0, margin=margin(t=15)))
```
